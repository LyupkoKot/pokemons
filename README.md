## Introduction

Welcome to the React Next.js Pokemon App! This project is a simple web application that displays a list of Pokemon using the GraphQL-Pokemon API. It utilizes various technologies like React, Next.js, GraphQL, Redux, React Context API, and Styled Components to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

The app allows users to search for Pokemon, view their details, and explore additional information about them. It's a great example of how to integrate multiple technologies to build a functional and engaging web application.
